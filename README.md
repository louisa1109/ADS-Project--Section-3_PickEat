# ADS Project name: PickEat
PickEat is an app devoted to help individuals, but especially students, manage their food and reach a balanced lifestyle.
With this tool you will be able to organise your daily life by displaying fast and healthy recipes to avoid waste.

Our app has four main functions:
1. It allows the user to have a better meal organisation thanks to the available calendar.
2. The app displays recipes based on the ingredients that the user provides.
3. It allows the user to search among the available recipes and chose the one he prefers.
4. It allows the user to store the ingredients in a shopping list.

# Installation 
For the code provided it is necessary to import a given dataset. 

To be able to run our program, make sure you have the following things installed:

- Python Programming Languange. 

- Libraries. In order to run the program, the following three libraries were used: pandas, numpy & io.

In order to install the library type the following command:

```pip install pandas```

```pip install numpy```

```pip install io```

After following these steps, you can now open the file and run the program.

# Usage
When a user joins our code platform, he is initially asked for his username and password, and welcomed. If one of the two is wrong, the program will ask to input them again. 
Next, the user is asked what he would like to do during that day, and is provided with five options to choose from. The user will have to input the number of the action he wants to perform. 
The actions are:
1. Look at your meal plan.
2. Pantry.
3. Shopping list.
4. Favourites.
5. Discover meals.
6. Exit.

After they made their choice, the respective action will be carried out. The user will be then asked other questions.

1. If the first option is chosen ("Look at your meal plan"), the platform will ask about the month and day he wants to see specifically.
Next, the user will be asked to input the meal he wants to see (choose between breakfast 1, lunch 2 and dinner 3).
The platform will display the recipes available, how to perform them and the ingredients needed.
After this, the user will be asked to input 'Enter' to go back to the main menu and start the process all over again.

2. If the second option is chosen ("Pantry"), the platform will ask the user if he wants to add or delete items from the pantry. In either case it will be asked what specific article and the amount of it that he wants to process. 
After adding or removing each article, the platform will ask the user whether or not he wants to continue.
Lastly, the platfrom will ask the user if he wants to see his pantry, only in the case where he has previously decided to stop adding and removing elements.

3. If the third option is chosen ("Shopping list"), the platform will ask the user if he wants to add or delete items from the shopping list. 
In either case the user will be asked to input the article and the amount of it he needs. 
After adding or removing each article, the platform will ask the user whether or not he wants to continue.
Lastly, the platfrom will ask the user if he wants to see his shopping list, only in the case where he has previously decided to stop adding and removing items.

4. If the fourth option is chosen ("Favourites"), the platform will ask the user if he wants to add or delete recipes from the favourites. In either case it will be asked what specific recipe he wants to process. 
After adding or removing each recipe, the platform will ask the user whether or not he wants to continue.
Lastly, the platfrom will ask the user if he wants to see his favourites, only in the case where he has previously decided to stop adding and removing recipes.

5. If the fifth option is chosen ("Discover meals"), the platform will ask the user if he wants to filter the available recipes between four options. 
The options are: 

a) Filter by type of ingredients. There are three proposed options: lactose free, vegetarian, gluten free or input specific ingredient. 

b) Filter by difficulty level. There are three proposed levels: beginner, sous chef and head chef. This enables the user to find recipes based on their complexity.

c) Filter by budget. The program will ask the user to input both maximum and minimum budget in order to decide which recipe to suggest based on cost of ingredients. 

d) Filter by a combination of these. The program will ask the user to input which options they want to combine, separating the answers with a comma. A combination of two randoms or all three can be chosen.
 
In general the program is going to display a maximum of 10 recipes based on the characteristics the user decided to input. 

6. If the fifth option is chosen ("Exit"), the user will just have to press 'Enter' to return the main menu.


# Extra information
In order to carry out our objective, we have used the following Data Structures:

- Linked Lists; 
- Hash tables;
- Lists;

And the following Algorithms:

- Insertion; used to insert items from pantry, favourites, and shopping list. 
- Deletion; used to deleted items from pantry, favourites, and shopping list. 
- Searching
- QuickSort Algorithm; used to sort the recipes from most expensive to least expensive. Used to order the recepies by difficulty. 
- Greedy Method; used to look for the best combination of meals available given the limited items in the pantry.
