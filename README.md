PickEat is an app devoted to help individuals, but especially students, manage their food and reach a balanced lifestyle.
With this tool you will be able to organise your daily life by displaying fast and healthy recipes to avoid waste.

Our app has four main functions:
1. It allows the user to have a better meal organisation thanks to the available calendar.
2. The app displays recipes based on the ingredients that the user provides.
3. It allows the user to search among the available recipes and chose the one they prefer.
4. It allows the user to store the ingredients in a shopping list.
